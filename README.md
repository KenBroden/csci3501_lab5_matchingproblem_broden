# Algorithm Steps and Results

By Ken Broden

## Steps

1. Initialization:
   1. A queue of free programmers is initialized.
   2. Each programmer starts by applying to their most preferred company that they have not yet applied to.
2. Iterative Matching:
   1. The algorithm iterates through the queue of free programmers.
   2. Each programmer applies to the next company on their preference list.
   3. If the company is free (not currently matched), the company and programmer are matched.
   4. If the company is already matched, the company decides whether to keep its current match or switch to the new applicant based on its preference list.
   5. If the company prefers the new applicant, the current match is added back to the queue of free programmers, and the new applicant is matched with the company.
   6. If the company prefers its current match, the programmer remains free and continues to apply to the next company on their list.
3. Termination:
   1. The algorithm terminates when there are no free programmers left who can apply to a company.

## Algorithm

The algorithm implemented in StableMatching is closely based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm. Gale-Shapley is designed to find a stable match between two equally sized sets of elements given their preferences. More can be found on the Gale-Shapley Algorithm on the wiki page [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm)

## Algorithm Efficiency

1. Outer Loop:
   - The outer while loop continues until all programmers are matched.
   - Each programmer can apply to every company once. Once a programmer has applied to all companies, they remain matched.
   - Since there are ùëõ programmers and ùëõ companies, in the worst case, every programmer may apply to every company.

2. Company Preference Step:
   - Each time a programmer applies to a company, the company checks if they are currently unmatched. If matched, the company compares the new programmer to its current match.
   - This check for preference is ùëÇ(1) because the company maintains a fixed preference list and can access the preference order in constant time.

3. Queue:
   - In the worst case, a programmer who is rejected by a company is added back to the queue. Each programmer can only be rejected a maximum of ùëõ‚àí1 times, as they can only apply to ùëõ companies.

In the worse case: Each programmer applies to each company exactly once. There are ùëõ programmers and each programmer can make at most ùëõ proposals. Therefore, the total number of proposals made is ùëõ^2. Each proposal results in the company checking its preference list and possibly updating the match, which takes constant time (ùëÇ(1)).

Thus, the overall worst-case time complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõ^2). This matches the time complexity of the Gale-Shapley algorithm which findStableMatches() is based on.
